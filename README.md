## Let's Dive In

Raffi3 is the first fully operable and decentralized NFT raffle platform on the Polygon network. Raffi3 is a full-stack web application built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel and is backed by our smart contract on the Polygon network. It is connected to Planetscale Database to store all of the raffle data. We leverage prisma and tRPC for a type-safe and perfomant application.

The platform gives the opportunity for users to raffle off their own NFTs on the Polygon chain. A seller can set the ticket supply, ticket price, and end date of the raffle. Buyers can buy tickets and have a chance at winning.

The winner of the raffle is chosen at random using Chainlink VRF. Upon conclusion, the winner is able to claim their NFT and funds are distributed to the seller.

## Why a Raffle Platform? And Why Polygon?

Polygon has recently taken dramatic steps to declare itself as a leader in the NFT space. They have continuously shown progress in brand acquisition and business development, and have also brought y00ts over from solana in an effort to curate an authentic community of NFT collectors and traders.

It is our belief that Polygon will continue to grow and expand its NFT ecoysystem. In that wake, we believe that NFT trading tools will be in high demand. We hope to front run their explosive growth by creating a platform that will be a staple in the Polygon NFT ecosystem and allow people to raffle off their NFTs, instead of selling them on traditional marketplaces.

Finally, we belive that Polygon's low latency and high throughput will allow for a smooth and enjoyable user experience. We hope to create a platform incentivizes users to buy tickets and participate in raffles because they do not have to worry about high gas fees.

## TODO

We believe that Raffi3 is a great start to a platform that will be a staple in the Polygon NFT ecosystem. However, there is still a lot of work to be done. Here are some of the features we would like to add in the future:

- [ ] Implementing buyer side "tips" in an era where royalties are dying out
- [ ] Partnering with new brands/projects to raise awareness on upcoming mints
- [ ] Insurance for raffles
- [ ] Raffles as a Service

## Wen Launch?

Theoretically, the platform is ready to launch on mainnet now. However, we want to take our time to fix all potential bugs and roll out a proper marketing campaign, so the demo is recorded on a custom testnet. We are aiming to go live in the next 2-3 weeks, but our MVP is ready now.
